- Comparative function: compare cpu and gpu implementation time of the same
operation. Initialise all needed data. May be needed to be in macro.
- Make matrix struct, change functions signatures according to it, and check
matrices dimensions at the beginning of functions.
- Add matrices creation function (i.e: RandomMatrix(w, h, low=0., high=1.))
