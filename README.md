# Polyneo

Matrix operations library implementation on GPU using Cuda-C

Operations supported :
[ ] Scalar product
[ ] Matrix addition
[ ] Matrix multiplication 
[ ] Determinant computaion
[ ] Matrix inversion
[ ] Singular value decomposition
[ ] Back substitution

The project will include the same operations on CPU to compare performance and resource utilization (memory, computing time, ...)

When relevant, different algorithms could be implemented for the same operation.
